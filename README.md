It's a small world

Summary: The It's a Small World algorithm is based on the popular 2019 game "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon." The goal of this algorithm is to find the shortest path between two casts from different movies. And the casts of various films will be saved in a list in string format.

We will be given a positive integer greater than 2, and the first two movie casts will be very significant because we will find the shortest connection between these, and if we find at least one, we can say we have one shortest connection. If there is no connection between the first two movie casts, we will look for another cast from the list of casts. If we discover a link between them, the shortest distance will be two. Otherwise, we return the shortest connection that is greater than two or no connection.

As a result, this algorithm will assist us in determining the relationship between movie casts.
